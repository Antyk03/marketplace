# Marketplace

A full-stack web application with a Java-based backend and an Angular frontend.

## Description

This project is a simple marketplace application. It consists of a server-side application that handles the business logic and a client-side application that provides the user interface. The application uses JWT for authentication and has CORS support, allowing the frontend and backend to communicate from different origins.

## Technologies Used

### Backend

*   **Java**: The core language for the backend.
*   **Gradle**: The build automation tool for the project.
*   **JWT**: JSON Web Tokens are used for authentication.

### Frontend

*   **Angular**: The framework used to build the user interface.
*   **TypeScript**: The language used for the frontend development.
*   **HTML & CSS**: For structuring and styling the web pages.

## Features

*   **User Authentication**: The application uses JWT for secure user authentication.
*   **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)**: The backend is configured to handle requests from different origins, allowing the frontend to be served from a different domain.
*   **RESTful API**: The backend likely exposes a RESTful API for the frontend to consume.
